- 👋 Hi, I’m @ALnCMForevr (Always Lucky n' Chris Moua Forever)
- 👀 I’m interested in coding, tennis, and music.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the syntax of different languages. I will learn to apply those skills to real projects in the near future.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything, not really sure what the specifics are yet. Just looking to improve my skillset.
- 📫 Feel free to message me through email (chris.moua98@gmail.com).
